  "description": "Database of income shares of top end of population for long time periods (e.g. 1875-present) for a variety of countries around the world.\r\n\r\nFrom [about page](http://g-mond.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/topincomes/):\r\n\r\n> There has been a marked revival of interest in the study of the distribution of top incomes using tax data. Beginning with the research by Piketty of the long-run distribution of top incomes in France (2001, 2003), a succession of studies has constructed top income share time series over the long-run for more than twenty countries to date. These projects have generated a large volume of data, which are intended as a research resource for further analysis.\r\n>\r\n> The world top incomes database aims to providing convenient on line access to all the existent series. This is an ongoing endeavour, and we will progressively update the base with new observations, as authors extend the series forwards and backwards. Despite the database's name, we will also add information on the distribution of earnings and the distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\n\r\nWe have only uploaded Layout A where every column is a variable; countries and years are in rows and it has been converted to CSV. Notes and units were in a separate sheet and have been extracted to a separate csv.\r\n\r\nData is partially normalized (what would be the variable column is denormalized out into columns). A future task would be to normalize the data.\r\n\r\n#### Comment\r\n\r\nWhole site is flash which means there is just one url for the whole site :-(\r\n\r\nHowever, good news is after ticking various boxes you can download the entire DB (though there is no direct url for this link that we can host here). Thus for convenience of reuse, an entire dump has been extracted here.\r\n\r\n#### Sources\r\n\r\nExtracted from first sheet of downloaded spreadsheet.\r\n\r\n* Argentina Alvaredo, Facundo (2010).
